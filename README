This small LaTex package provides the rendering of American style Karnaugh maps
as found in many American text books on Digital Design. There are four files:

README      - this file
askmaps.sty - the package file
askmaps.tex - the documention with examples
askmaps.pdf - PDF version of the documentation

The Karnaugh maps are rendered with picture commands; only the pict2e package
is loaded.

The Tikz package can be use to shape the Karnaugh maps as pleased.

Current version is 0.2. At this point, only 1-5 variable Karnaugh maps
are supported. People familiar with the Karnaugh package should have
no problem in using the macros in this package.

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome at J.E.J.opdenBrouw@hhs.nl

Happy TeX-ing!
